Generative AI Usage Declaration for Exercise 4

I used OpenAI's ChatGPT to assist in the development of Exercises 4.
Specifically, ChatGPT was used to:

Help generate, modify, and troubleshoot D3.js code for creating various visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).
Provide guidance on applying styles and attributes to HTML and SVG elements.
Suggest improvements to enhance readability and structure of the graphs.
All final coding decisions and written content were made by myself.
